Hidden Trail~
The path takes a sharp turn here, bending around to the east and south. 

The drab grey of the surrounding area mirrors the dull gravel of the

path, creating a lackluster, dismal landscape.  Looking northward, you

see only a barren field of grey stone.  To the south, trees loom at ever

closer intervals, split by a small path which winds its way deep into the

stone forest.

A Winding Trail~
The somber, grey trail runs through the colorless area surrounding it. 

The vegetation which borders the trail has sickened and died, leaving

only brown leaves and blackened stems behind.  Standing at irregular

intervals, a few tall, slender trees dot the area to the south of the

path.  The trees are a drab, grey color, right down to the leaves.

Closer examination of the slender trees reveals that they have been

turned to stone.  The delicate stone leaves have broken off in places,

leaving razor-sharp shards of broken stone behind.  Littering the ground

near the trunks of the trees is a myriad of broken stone in the shapes of

twigs, leaves, and even the occasional branch.

A Hidden Trail - Near a Stone Sapling~
In the middle of the trail upon which you stand, a small stone tree

stands.  The sapling's trunk is only as thick as a man's forearm,

indicating its scant age.  Grey vines of ivy wind their way around the

oak sapling, giving the semblance of leaf-bearing limbs.  The rocky

ground around the tree supports only dead and dying vegetation.  A few

scraggly young trees try to grow in the poor soil around the trail,

though their leaves are scant and brown.

This tall, thin sapling was once a thriving, vibrant young oak.  Its

itself around the stone tree, giving a semblance of life to the petrified

On Path to Woods~
Dying, scraggly trees hang their bare limbs down over the path, as if

reaching for what little life is still left near the forest floor.  The

few green plants left among the brownish dead brush struggle to reach the

sun.  Greying ivy strangles the last bits of life out of the dwarfed

trees, even as the vines themselves perish.

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
A gentle breeze blows through the silent forest, passing over you in a

gentle caress.  The stone leaves of the tall oak trees stir not at all,

immobilized forever.  Petrified bushes border the trail through the

forest, pruned and trimmed into patterns nature never intended.  A few

stone birds perch on the limbs of the petrified oaks, are frozen for all

time.

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
Bushes of solid rock line the trail along this portion of it, while

beyond the bushes stand a wealth of tall, slender oaks.  Well trimmed and

pruned, the bushes were in full bloom when their metamorphosis was

effected.  Delicate stone flowers peek out from between the flinty leaves

of the shrubbery.

Hidden Trail~
The silent, somber trail is bordered here by drab, ashen vegetation.  The

plants cling to their precarious existence, the hard, rocky ground

allowing no room for water to flow to their roots.  Dwarfed, twisted

trees grow in small patches to the south, their leaves long since fallen. 

Fist-sized rocks are scattered around this section of the forest,

cluttering the trail.  The absence of vivid color is profound; the faint

green of the dying plants the only hue other than the dismal grey.

Hidden Trail~
The drab landscape around you is limned in shades of grey.  The light grey

of the dry, ash-like dirt which covers the ground on and around the trail

blends with gravel of a darker grey.  The few struggling plants which grow

in the harsh, rocky soil are limp and wilting, all the green draining out

of them to be slowly replaced by a greyish-brown color.

Hidden Trail~
An opaque, swirling mist creeps along the ground.  A faint breeze blows in

from the north, tattering the veil of mist aside in places to reveal

rocky, uneven ground.  Patches of gravel and grey, lifeless dirt are

visible for a moment before the mist closes back in.  The smell of death

and decay wafts past your nostrils, carried in from the north by the light

breeze.

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
The trail winds its way through the crowded stone trees of the petrified

forest.  Preserved in their summer glory for all eternity, the stone oaks

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
Tall, slender pillars of stone jut out of the grey earth, the remnants of

these once magnificent young oaks.  Branching out from the stone trunks

are thin, fragile limbs covered with delicate stone leaves.  A few of the

flinty leaves have fallen to the ground to shatter into a myriad of

jagged shards.  The path which runs north and south through the desolate

forest has fallen into disrepair and you must pick your way carefully

through the broken fragments of stone.

Corner of the Stone Forest~
A corner in the forest is made by a stone hedge to the north and a thick

wall of trees to the west.  One of the great oaks has splintered in half,

yet remains upright, supported by its grey neighbors.  The forest floor

is thick with rubble, almost thick enough to be gravel.  The oaks must

have been tranquil in life, but now their jagged, broken branches and

unmoving leaves give them a sinister aspect.

Edge of Woods~
The stone trees stand silent and still.  Broken limbs and leaves lie here

like tumbled masonry.  Few of the trees are in good condition, all are

missing limbs and leaves.  A stone hedge runs along the forest to the

north.  No branches lean over this barrier, as if it were more than just

a physical presence.  The forest of stone continues in every other

direction.

Edge of Woods~
One of the mighty oaks here had fallen long before the forest was turned

to stone.  Smaller oaks, less than twenty feet, have grown up and filled

in the space it once occupied.  The forest is lighter here partly because

of the fallen tree.  The fallen trunk is covered with crescent shaped

stone mushrooms.  The forest to the north is impassable because of dense

undergrowth.  The rest of the forest seems easily traversable, save for

the broken limbs and pieces of stone that are a constant nuisance.

Broken pieces of stone lay where they have fallen, some with a bird or a

Stone Forest - Within the Borders of the Forest~
The forest stands silent and desolate in its monotonous greyness.  The

tree trunks are close together, their stony boughs hopelessly intertwined

into a flinty canopy overhead.  Precious little light could filter through

the tangled mass above.  The ground is littered with broken shards of

stone leaves that have fallen in a rather sad parody of autumn.  It is

possible to make your way through the trees on three sides, but to the

east the trees form an impenetrable barrier of stone trunks.

The Stone Forest - A Wall of Oaks~
Crowded oaks end your westward progress at this desolate edge of the

forest, and the jutting pillars of the greater oaks can be seen in an

almost panoramic view to the east.  A shattered pile of stone lies on the

ground, with a few delicate grey feathers littering the area around it. 

To the west, the oak trees crowd in, forming a flinty wall of grey stone

Grey stone stretches in every direction as far as the eye can see.  The

this bleak landscape.  Thick, petrified brush blocks passage to the west. 

The forest of stone is thinner in the other directions, however;  only

avoiding sharp fragments of stone present a challenge.

Clearing - Stone Grass~
What was once a beautiful meadow has become a bleak, empty clearing in a

silent forest.  Razor-sharp, waist-high grass covers the empty meadow

here; growing shorter in every direction but the east.  A fine, powdery

dust covers the stony ground here, perhaps from grass that has been

crushed to dust.  The tall trees of the somber grey forest can be seen in

Trees grow too close to be bypassed to the south, but to the north and

Stone Forest - Southern Edge~
A bear stands frozen in stone here, mouth extended towards a raspberry

bush.  The forest stands exactly the same as it was that day, frozen in

stone for eternity.  Sharp thorns on the raspberry bush make a venture to

the south unappealing.  Instead of seeming to be outside the forest here

feels almost as if it were formed inside a cavern.  Even the most direct

sunlight barely filters through the stone leaves here.

Stone Forest - Near a Tiny Stream~
A thin trickle of water runs through the center of this area of the

forest.  Dancing over the rocks and stones of the small streambed, the

tiny brook burbles along cheerfully.  A few drooping plants have taken

root near the stream, trying desperately to leech life out of the sterile

layer of dust.  The stone trees stand in a forbidding wall to the south,

blocking any attempt at passage.

Stone Forest - A Silent Corner of the Woods~
This corner of the forest is silent and grim.  The lovely stone trees

stand as silent sentinels, watching over the forest eternally.  A few

blades of grass struggle to grow in the lifeless grey soil, which is

little more than the dust of ground stone.  Stone limbs lie scattered

around on the forest floor, shattered by the drop to the hard ground.

Clearing - Stone Grass~
The flinty grass here would be almost to the chest of the average human,

at least if it were still intact.  Large trails have been smashed through

the clearing here by some immense creature, reducing the grass in its

wake to a powdery stony dust.  Curiously, the damage seems to be

localized to this section of the clearing.  A lone tree towers over the

forest just east of here.

Stone Forest - By a Clearing~
The forest comes to an abrupt end here before a clearing filled with tall

grass.  Massive oaks are in many stages of existance, some bear almost

all of their leaves, others have lost almost all of their branches and

look like strange monuments.  From the south-west a rank smell wafts

through the air, perhaps a sign of life in this bleak place.  The forest

thickens to the east and north, while long grass grows to the south and

west.

blasted and many of the trees here bear scars from whatever caused the

damage.  A stand of trees has fallen to the west, forming a pile of stone.

A few of the stone trees here are still standing, unlike the totally

The ground is covered in fragments of trees and a fine, powdered stone

rests on top of them.  Branches that still cling to their trees make it

seem as though skeletal arms were reaching long arms towards you.

Twinned oak trees stand silently in the desolate remains of the forest. 

The texture of the two trunks reveal that they had grown together from

time long past, and had not merely toppled against each other after being

unable to support their new weight.  The elegant arching of the two trees

creates a long patch of twilight grey against the slate-colored ground of

the forest.  The silent stone forest continues in every direction, each

way the same, drab grey.

Stone Forest~
Pieces of rubble have formed a pile at the base of a small hill here. 

The trees in the area show signs of damage; broken branches and scorch

marks are easily noticed.  Though only the northernmost trees bear

extensive damage many of the trees are missing a majority of their leaves. 

The forest continues in every direction, but to the north blackened

stumps are all that remain of trees.

A Devestated Area in the Stone Forest~
The ground is completely barren save for shattered pieces of stone, a

layer of dust, and some charred, broken stumps.  Some powerful force

ripped the trees asunder and was hot enough to vaporize the stone.  The

stumps grow taller farther to the south, away from the origin of the

blast.  Only from the trees to the south can you guess that these were

once oak trees.

A Low Hill in the Stone Forest - Before a Holy Shrine~
The trees have all been cleared away from this low hill.  Set on the

summit of the small mound, a circle of smoothly polished stone rings the

crown of the hill.  Only six inches high and perhaps three inches wide,

the stone ring is nearly fifteen feet in diameter.  In the middle of the

tall, majestic, stone oak.

A Devastated Area of the Forest - Near a Lone Oak~
In the midst of this decimated, shattered area of the forest, one lone

oak stands untouched by the devastation.  The area all around it is

covered with glistening shards of razor-sharp stone.  The splintered

trunks of other trees not so lucky are testimony to the fact that some

force intervened to preserve the lone oak.

The Stone Forest - Near a Fallen Oak~
A massive trunk of stone lies on the ground here, covered in rubble from

fallen leaves.  The solid floor of the forest melds with the monolith

structure of the fallen oak, hinting that this tree was downed and

rotting since before it was changed to this flinty grey stone.  The oaks

that remain standing are bare of all but the smallest leaves and the

strongest limbs, and create angular shadows across the ashen plain.

Stone Forest~
The sound of moving water somewhere to the east is the first thing you

The forest to the south has been untouched by such things however, and

the mighty oaks are for the most part intact.  One of the great trees has

split down its center but its great trunk is still too strong to fall.

Stone Forest - Stone Stumps~
Grey moss and ivy encircle the stone stumps of several trees here. 

Beside each stump grows a tiny sapling, perhaps only a few weeks old. 

The tiny leaves on the fledgeling trees are petite versions of the leaves

borne by elder oaks.  Some of the saplings have been blown over by the

powerful explosion to the northwest.  The absence of the overwhelmingly

massive oaks in this area makes the forest seem oddly barren.

precariously at the northern edge of the ten foot crevice, seemingly

ready to topple in at any moment.  A patch of sky can be made out through

a hole in the trees where the crack is, a break in the monotonous grey

The grim, grey silence of the stone forest is disrupted by the soft

sounds of running water to the south.  The massive stone oaks stand at

intervals, locked in the semblance of summer for eternity.  A myriad of

stone leaves have fallen to the forest floor, creating a blanket of sharp

shards of stone.  A stone snake coils near the base of one of the trees,

caught forever in readiness to strike at some unknown prey.

Stone Forest~
Like the forest to the west, the forest here has been devastated.  The

explosion that destroyed the forest to the west has decimated the trees

here, causing them to lose most of their branches and leaves.  Most of

the trees towards the west have been shattered into splinters, leaving

only their trunks.  Something else has caused further destruction here,

jagged tooth marks are gouged into several of the trees, and others have

simply been knocked down.

Stone Forest~
The greyish trees in this area of the forest are all torn and broken.

However, the damage appears to have been done long before the trees'

transformation to stone.  One great behemoth of an oak tree lies on the

ground here, its trunk cut neatly away.  The tree lies here on its side,

surrounded by the limbs and leaves of other trees that were torn away as

the massive oak fell.

Stone Forest~
Broken and lifeless trees tower over the pale ground.  Nothing stirs in

their branches, nothing stirs on the ground.  A few trees to the south

have toppled from some force other than their immense weight.  One of the

fallen trees is held standing at an angle by the trunk of another tree. 

The forest continues in every direction, fuller and more intact to the

north, blasted and devestated to the south.

Stone Forest - Near an Old Campsite~
A gentle breeze flows through the area from the west, carrying with it

the gentle sound of running water.  The stone flora is thick, the stone

leaves of many plants tangle together creating a barrier to the east.  A

ring of small rocks has been piled together to create a makeshift hearth

for a fire.  Travel is hampered by small plants and bushes though there

is enough space to traverse between them.

[Ylena] the last line would sound better if it read something like: is

enough space to traverse between them.

Two sticks jut up from the ground, supporting a spit from which hangs a

A canopy of tangled stone branches shelters the area from the sky.  A

myriad of stone leaves in various states of condition lie scattered all

along the forest floor.  Moss and ivy that cling to the stone trees have

turned to flinty grey stone.  Lustrous grey stone trees surround you on

all sides, though to the north, west, and south you could probably

squeeze through the oak trunks.  To the east, an impregnable barrier of

intertwined trees prevents passage.

Stone Forest - Before a Shattered Gap in the Trees~
The trees come to an abrupt end here, closing in so thickly that nothing

could slip through the impenetrable stone wall of oaks.  However, blown

right through the middle of the seemingly impervious bastion is a gaping

hole.  About ten feet in diameter, the hole is almost perfectly circular. 

The bottoms of the devastated trees are still mostly intact, while the

intertwined tangle of stone boughs holds the tops in their original

places, defying gravity.

Stone Forest - Near a Stone Druid~
A tall, majestically beautiful stone oak stands here, proudly hanging its

grey boughs out over the area.  Strangely enough, the oak stands in

seeming dominance over the other trees.  At the base of the petrified oak

a man kneels, though he, too, is as petrified as every other creature in

this sad forest.  One stone hand is placed on the tree trunk, the other

raised to the heavens clasping a strange symbol.  Passage to the east is

blocked by a barrier of close oaks.

Stone Forest - Near a Crimson Blossom~
Overshadowed by a forbidding wall of densely packed trees to the east, the

forest is grim and grey.  Stone ivy vines rest lightly on the petrified

trunks of adult oak trees.  A few petrified plants resting around the

bases of the oak trees bear delicate stone blossoms, brittle to the touch.

One flowering plant retains a single red flower, a splash of crimson

which breaks the desolate monotony of the grey landscape.

Shards of stone that have been melted together lie in heaps along the

Stone Grove - A Great Stone Archway~
A great archway made of vines and branches stands just to the south. 

Some of the twining limbs have broken off under their great weight and

litter the ground underneath.  The trees here look well tended and the

ground is clear of clutter save what has fallen since the petrification. 

The ground dips to the north, sloping down into a shallow depression.  A

path runs around the pool to either side.

Clearing - Near a Wall of Stone Oaks~
This clearing is littered with an incredible amount of stone debris. 

Although at one time this area may have been covered in grass or

underbrush of some sort, any traces of the original plant life in this

area were obliterated when a mighty stone oak fell from the thicket to

the west.  Large piles of bird droppings stain the stone debris and dusty

ground where no shards litter it.  The clearing continues in all

directions but west.

Clearing - Borders of the Stone Forest~
Petrified grass stands a handspan tall in this forest clearing, although

much of the grass has been smashed or shattered by someone or something. 

The ground is covered with crisscrossing tracks and a smattering of

droppings of some creature.  A thicket of mighty oaks which stands

northwest of here would have been difficult to traverse before the

petrification, and now would be impossible to maneuver through.  This

bleak clearing extends in the distance to the south and east.

only large, ancient oaks grow in this grove.  The path leads west and

Stone Grove - Faint Path~
A winding path leads through the forest.  The path continues to the north

and south, between the silent, stone trees.  A wall of sorts has been

formed at the edge of the clearing by a bramble bush to the east.  Only

the mightiest oak trees grow here, towering over the forest floor.  The

ground is surprisingly clear of fallen debris, the trees have held up

remarkably well.  Fallen stone leaves and rock branches cover the bottom

of a dried up pond to the west.

The drab grey trees tower over the faint trail here.  Passage between the

Stone Grove - Faint Path~
The trail through the woods turns gently to the west and south around the

dried up pond.  Trees to the north grow much too close together to travel

through.  The top of a fallen stone oak blocks the way to the east. 

Other than an occasional fallen branch or leaf the ground is clear of

debris.  The towering oaks creak alarmingly under the weight of their

stone limbs.  That they still stand at all is a testament to their

strength.

Stone, like everything else, the cattails line the trail to the south

west.  Too tall to see over, they screen the view of whatever lies to the

south-west.

~
E
trail path~
Here the trail curves slowly around a bed of catttails to the south-west. 

The trail doesn't continue in a straight line.  Instead it wanders about

the forest in a random path.

~
E
oaks trees~
The oaks here are massive, their trunks easily as wide as 5 humans.  It

would take a great force to knock such a tree down, even the added weight

of being petrified hasn't made them fall.

~
E
1 east top~
The top of a massive oak has fallen here.  Its surface is covered with

cracks and jagged holes caused from its landing.  Most of its branches

have been jarred loose by the impact and lie on the ground near the trunk. 

Climbing over the jagged cracks and sharp branches would be far too

hazardous.

~
E
1 north~
The trees seem to grow wide and close together, almost forming a wall. 

Passing between them would have been difficult before they were

petrified, now it is impossible.

Stone Grove - Faint Path~
A winding trail leads through the forest here, passing around a dried up

pond to the southeast.  The forest to the west is too thick and choked

with undergrowth to be passable.  No undergrowth occupies the forest

floor here, its only covering is fallen leaves which have long since been

turned to stone.  You get the feeling that the silent, grey trees are

watching you, though that is impossible.

stone trees~
Perfectly still, the trees are the dull grey of stone.  The trees of the

grove seem relatively intact, though stone leaves and fallen branches

show that this part of the forest too has taken its share of damage.

The path is curved here, bypassing a dried-up pond to the south-west. 

Though the path never travels in any one direction for long it slowly

meanders to the south and east.

Empty of the life-giving water that once filled it, the pond is little

more than a dent in the ground now.

Unlike the grove, the forest floor to the west is covered with bushes and

undergrowth.  Making a path would have been impossible even if the forest

weren't made of stone.

1 north~
The trees to the north grow thick and close together.  They grow in

Stone Grove - Before a Tunnel of Branches~
A faint trail branches here in three directions.  To the east and west it

goes around a petrified bed of cattails.  The northern fork leads into a

tunnel of sorts through the trees.  The cattails to the south are much

too thick to be passable.  Stone wildflowers cover the ground under the

mighty canopy of oaks, having taken advantage of the lack of undergrowth. 

Where once the buzz of bees might have filled the air now it is quiet

save for the occasional crack of a stone branch snapping under its own

weight.

Stone Grove - End of the Faint Path~
A tunnel has been formed here by the branches of the oaks.  The oaks grow

too close together to allow passage in any direction other than the one

you came from.  A single hole in the branches overhead allows sunlight to

stream down into the clearing during daylight and moonlight at night.  A

slight breeze whistles through the the stone trees, but fails to stir any

leaves or move any branches.  Surprisingly, no broken branches or fallen

leaves litter the ground here.  Wildflowers petrified in bloom decorate

this area with their pale beauty.

A Bleak Clearing - Edge of the Stone Forest~
Hand-high, grey grass covers this southwestern corner of a clearing in

the forest.  Silent stone boughs overhang the clearing from the darker

forest that looms to the south and west, too intertwined with stony

undergrowth to allow travel into the woods.  Although this area must have

once been very peaceful, an oppressive silence now hangs over this forest

clearing.  Not even the tiniest plant seems to have made a foothold in

this lifeless, grey dirt.

Somewhere Within a Roiling Pool~
This pool of brackish, acidic water is dimly lit, although the acid

stings your eyes and makes it difficult to see.  The water churns and
