Great North Road~
The road here is muddy and rutted, and a small stream on the side of the

route contributes to the muck.  The wide path and shallow water make

their way north and south through the wooded foothills.  The woodland

offers many hiding places among the trees and underbrush, a good place

for theives and highwaymen to wait for prey.

Great North Road~
The wide trail crosses a shallow stream and heads further into the hills

to the north and south.  Dense, dark woods grow on either side of the

road, filled with shadows and an occasional muffled sound.  Forest debris

is scattered across the way, pound into the dirt where others have

traveled in their journey along the path.

Great North Road~
The road follows along the ridges of the forested hills and continues as

far north and south as you can see.  The trees are a little thinner on

the tops of the low ridges but the road is the only sign of civilization

within the dense forest growth.  A thick growth of bushes chokes the

forest on the west.

Great North Road~
The trees and undergrowth are thin here as the trail heads north and

south on the steep slope of a large plateau.  Nothing but hardy clumps of

grass grow atop the flat hill to the north and the forest thickens to the

south.  A large, flat rock with a worn surface juts out of the hillside,

offering a resting spot in your journey along the road.

Great North Road~
The wide road crosses directly north and south across a large tussock

plateau.  The hardy, yellowish grasses grow in clumps across the flat

hill and give no ground to trees or other forest growth.  The

tree-covered hills surround you and high, jagged peaks rise above the

foothills to the northeast.

Little upon this high mountain plateu gives relief from the sea of

A chilling wind blowing from the northeast feels as if it came directly

from the high snowy peaks which rise up in that direction.

Yellowish-brown clumps of grass grow across this wide plateau.  There are

no signs of people aside from the road, no houses, no farms, not even an

abandoned building to mark civilization upon this tussock land.  The

wooded hills rise into mountains on the east, topped by magnificent

snow-capped peaks.

Great North Road~
This is the northern end of a long, high plateau of tussock land where

little grows but the yellowish clumps of hearty grass.  Just to the east

a wide, well-used road passes by and you can see it stretch across the

plateau heading south.  To the north the hills become more steep and

jagged, rising to meet the mighty peaks of the Dragonspire Mountains

which rise above the landscape on the northeast.

Great North Road~
You are on the edge of a wide plateau which stretches off to the south

and west.  Clumpy, yellow-green grass grows across the flat hilltop, and

a few scattered bushes are the only other plant life to be seen.  A large

pile of quarried stone and old, broken tools lies just off the side of

the road, which makes its way northward down the slope and south across

the plateau.  Small plants and moss have grown over the materials,

indicating their undisturbed presence here for some time.

Great North Road~
The road passes through a burned-out section of the forested hills where

little has regrown except patches of scrub and brush.  The road becomes

quite wide without the trees and other obstructions to restrict its

north-south path.  Tall pine trees surround the burned area and jagged

hills rise up all around you.

The Great North road heads north and south through rocky terrain, winding

its way between the steep slopes rising up on the east and west.  Tall

evergreen trees cover the slopes and rocky outcroppings poke out amid the

pines.  To the north you can see a tall stone obelisk rising above the

trees.

The road gently climbs into the mountains which rise steadily towards the

northeast and descends down the slopes to the east.  The road is well

maintained and stone markers placed every few yards designate the way.  A

dense forest of pine trees stands above and below the road on the

mountainsides, their tall straight trunks rising high above the mountain

slopes.

The road makes a steady westward climb up the mountainside and gradually

heads downslope towards the east where you can see a tall obelisk

standing above the trees.  The stately evergreens stand like sentinels on

the mountainsides with their straight posture and rich cloaks of green

needles moving slowly in the mild wind.

The road continues to wind in and out of gullies as it continues its

remarkably steady climb into the mountains and drop onto the plains.

Whoever constructed this road took great care in making the gradient as

constant as possible.  The forested slopes of ever-green pine trees fill

the valleys and cloth the slopes in a carpet of green regardless of the

season.  The snow covered mountains are very close and the clear mountain

air makes it seem as though you could reach out and touch them.

grow up the slopes, growing shorter and fatter as they get closer to the

top of the mountains.

trees that are below the ridge on the steep slopes are much thinner and

more stunted here than further down.

The road settles into a almost straight line east to west, sloping up to

the west and descending gently to the east.  Loose gravel has been laid

over the packed dirt, providing traction and keeping the road from

turning into a river of mud.  The road cuts along the side of a mountain,

with a sharp drop-off south and a rock wall north.

Loose gravel crunches underfoot as the road continues is inexorable way

towards some spectacularly tall snow-covered mountains.  North, the way

is blocked by a rock wall, a result of the road cutting through the side

of the mountain.  South is a sharp drop-off, with the tops of small,

stunted pines just visible.

A blot of greyish-brown on the horizon gradually makes its way through

the mountains, winding from as far east as you can see to the ground

beneath your feet.  To the west, a dark patch of bedrock can be seen as a

short cliff rises from the road surface.  Snow-crested peaks cradle the

small block of sky above your head like a precious gem, and not a cloud

can be seen marring its jewel-like clarity.

south, their massive, spear-like shapes jutting from the ground like

uneven teeth.  The road continues from the west to east, marked by a

rough dirt trail.

The road continues its steady climb up to the west here, leading further

dizzying heights.  To the south, a small, clearly antiquated road cuts

its way between the rock walls and disappears down a steep slope to the

south.

The road inclines as it rises to meet the mountains to the west.  Small

Scattered shadows and stray patches of light filter down through the

itself through a break in the almost solid wall of conifers, continuing

on to the east and west.  A gentle gradient can be detected in the road,

sloping down gently to the west.  Pine cones, needles, and some small

pieces of deadwood litter the road, giving the impressions of disuse and

disrepair.

This wide dirt trail travels sinuously from west to east, marked by loose

side of the road, with polished ivory walls that gleam among the dark

evergreens.  A few young evergreens grow along the edge of the road,

their tough branches repelling the harsh mountain climate.  The road is

slightly slanted, making travel a little more difficult to the west,

where the road continues to climb up into the mountains.

the bushes are almost symmetrically planted along the trail.  Many

sharp-looking pine needles lie scattered beside the bushes, fallen from

the tall pine trees from above.

Not much grows along this beaten path, except for an occasional wild

flower.  Travel eastward along this seemingly endless trail has been

blocked off by an enormous boulder.  Passage can continue for many miles

west of you, while the trail continues south around the boulder.

Mountain Road - Intersection~
The road continues on its path through the Cairn Mountains.  The ground

continues to slope upwards to the west, but a smaller, apparently older

and less frequently used byway branches off to the south, down a slope

and into a cleft between two great mountains.

Many bushes and saplings have started to grow along this extensive trail. 

Spanning the southern horizon is the Cairn Mountain range, the

snow-capped peaks of the mountains creating a breath-taking view. 

Looking up and west, you notice a lot more vegetation beginning to

overtake the trail.  To the east, the trail slopes downward and appears

less green.

The fresh smell of the vegetation all around the trail revitalizes your

senses as you continue along this tiresome trek.  Thick green leaves and

long stems clutter the ground, making travel a little rugged, as you

attempt to avoid stepping on them.  The trail slopes a little up as it

leads westward into more overgrown vegetation.  Looking east, you see

that the abundant vegetation has thinned out.

impeding your progress.  The musty smell of damp and rotting vegetation

wafts up from the tangle of plants.

The rocky trail is steep and worn.  Heading downward to the east, the

occasional scatter of stones passes you by on its way down the mountain.

The slender white trees which hang their branches over the trail grow

closely together, crowding each other out in their effort to reach the

sun.

A thin covering of reddish, powdery soil covers the trail here.  Sifting

down slowly from the mountain, the reddish dust settles lightly on the

trail, rocks, and plants, giving them a rust colored cast.  The trail is

cracked and muddy, forcing slow, careful passage.  Far above the trail,

aspens and pines grow thick, clinging to the sparse soil.

into the rusty red mud.  Tiny pine trees, no more than a season old, dot

the muddy area.

The wide dirt trail has narrowed here, as the ground begins to become

rockier and steeper to the west.  Thick lines of white, sharp rocks line

the edge of the road.  To the north, a wall of evergreens stick up toward

the sky, their tough green needles surviving despite the chill air.  To

the south, a small ridge has started to form on the edge of the road, and

the tops of pines below it stick out of the edge of the ridge.

evergreens grows along the north edge of the mountain road here.  Thick

rock rises up just beyond them, as a monolith has jutted out of the

terrain.  The road is bordered on the south by a deep ridge, below which

can be seen a forest of pine that grows like a beard around the mountain.

out the path.  South of here the ridge drops off into a forest of pines

far below.

Rocky Hills~
A few pine trees grow on this steep slope, between boulders and sharp

rock shelves, but the sharp, rising angle of the ground and lack of soil

offer little purchase for roots to take hold.  Downslope to the west,

several roads converge at a crossroads, where a large stone obelisk has

been raised.  The ground continues to rise to the east and north of here,

becoming too steep and rocky to ascend.  High, rocky hills fill the area

and the peaks of the high Dragonspire Mountains rise in the east.

Ashen-hued granite soars into the sky to the north, seemingly dark

against the pristine white of the mountains.  The rocky gravel of the

road seems to spill off of a steep ledge, littering the snow below past

normal boundaries of the trail.  A ladder has been cut out of the cliff,

making the drop of only ten feet much easier to climb.

planted at the point where the two roads converge.

It was obviously placed here some time ago, probably as a marker.

Granite, the color of a rainy sky, lies piled up into a large cairn to

The sharpness of the air stings your lungs, and a puff of smoke heralds

your every breath.

Great North Road~
The edges of the road are obscured by weeds and bits of dark grey stone,

but the center of the road is well-worn and mildly rutted.  A faint

passage leads off to the south, toward a smaller valley.  The foothills

which surround you are covered with rocks, tall pine trees and thick

undergrowth.  The steep, rocky hill to the east shows signs of age and

weather and its sharply rising slope offers no footing.  Several shrubs,

covered with prickly brown thorns, grow just in front of the hill.

valley to turn south and west.  The mountains are covered with heavy

brambles, and it would be difficult to climb them.  On the western side

of this valley are smaller, gentler rolling hills.

Great North Road~
The road gently curves to the north and west, following the contours of a

foothill of the Cairn Mountains.  Large rocks which have fallen from that

very hill makes passage quite tricky.  To the southeast, you can see the

gradual rise of the Dragonspires, high and treeless against the horizon.

Great North Road~
The remnants of the Great North Road seem to struggle to survive nature

and the elements in this harsh climate.  The road is wide enough here

for four orcs to march in formation without having to touch one another. 

To the north lies a gully filled with loose rocks.

Steep Slope~
You stand precariously on a steep northward rise.  The ground is hard and

rocky, and littered with loose stones.  To the south and east, you can

see the remains of the barely navigable Great North Road.  The rocky

hills to the north and west look unscalable from here.

Great North Road~
The road continues to the east and west, unimpeded by the nearby hills. 

Just to the north lies a deep gully.  The entire southern view is blocked

by the side of a low, wide hill, which is distinguished by an almost

completely flat top.  The hill itself is not covered by any vegetation,

and many loose stones that have slid down its steep sides lie in a heap

by the roadside.

Great North Road~
The Great North Road runs east and west, following a narrow valley.  To

the north runs a deep gully, and to the south is the base of a steep hill. 

The quality of the road is quite poor, and it has been eroded by time and

the elements.

The Great North Road twists and turns through the mountain foothills. 

The elements have not been kind to the highway, and much of it has been

battered by falling rocks, eroded by rain and snow and worn by frequent

travellers.  You can tell that the road goes east and south from here,

but cannot see around the crags to see what lies beyond.

The road is forced to take a very sharp turn here to avoid a small stand

of thin, scraggly pines.  A tall, rounded hill lies to the east of the

road, almost forming a a perfect 'C' amidst all the assorted shapes of

the foothills.  This foothill, unlike its neighbors, is heavily covered

with pine trees, and presents a splotch of green in a gray and brown

world.

Rough, porous limestone forms the jagged walls of this cavern.  The

floor, worn smooth with travel, slopes sharply upward and downward.  This

cavern is cool and silent.  From below floats the pungent stench of

rotting vegetation.

Rotted Cavern~
Deep gouges scar the limestone walls.  From jagged outcroppings of stone

hang thick clumps of rotted, black moss.  This entire cavern seems dead -

the scarred stone is like a skeleton, decayed and left hollow like empty,

fleshless ribs.  Every thread of moss has died and is rotting away with

the stench of decay.  The cavern begins it way up a stall, steep slope

above, or it heads eastward.

Among the Rubble~
Massive boulders lie piled among a rocky layer of dust and pebbles.  Deep

holes in the walls and ceiling still let tufts of dust fall, choking the

still air.  This entire cavern groans as if the stone is pulling itself

apart.  The cavern path continues through the rubble, as someone has

moved the larger boulders aside and piled them along the walls.  The path

moves northward, or slopes downward into yet more darkness.

Mountain Road~
The gently sloping road, rising west and descending east, is

well-maintained.  Packed dirt is topped with loose gravel, keeping the

road from becoming too muddy.  The road has been cut on the side of the

mountain, and a bare rock wall rises straight up to your north.

Shadowed Pillars~
Dark stony walls gives way to a sandy-colored limestone from the south to

the north of this cavern.  Stubby pillars of mostly pure limestone are

scattered through the northern section of the corridor, while some stray

surface debris can be seen in the lighter shadows on the floor to the

south.  Rays of light can be seen streaming in from what seems like a

hole in the ceiling to the south, and the entirety of the cavern roof

slopes unevenly away from the fissure.

stubby pillars limestone~
Roughly the thickness of a human's leg, these knobbly pillars of sand and

rock stretch between the cavern floor and the uneven roof before the

ceiling slopes away into darkness to the north.
