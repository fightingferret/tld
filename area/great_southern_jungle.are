Interlocking branches make a somewhat stable platform that can be walked

on as long as care is taken.  The view of the jungle that is able to be

seen through the many leaves shows that the jungle stretches for a great

distance, although just to the east a clearing can be seen.  Many thick

vines hang about in the jungle's canopy, with some of them bearing

flowers, and other a yellow fruit.  seen.  Many thick vines hang about in

Just Under the Jungle's Canopy~
The close growth patterns of the jungles trees enables a natural platform

of interlocking branches to form.  This platform is fairly strong and

feels like it could support the weight of many individuals, however some

care has to be taken when moving about so not to step in the myriad gaps

in the platform.  North and east this natural platform continues,

although some careful manoeuvring around a tree trunk is needed to go est. 

Prolific in number, vines hang from everywhere here.

flows through the clearing, entering from the north to leave via the east. 

The clearing continues south, while in every other direction vine-covered

jungle waits.

A Secluded Corner in the Steaming Jungle~
A thick wall of trees and plants encircles this section of the jungle,

with the only way out being to the south.  It seems that someone has

taken advantage of the natural walls provided by nature and constructed a

lean-to style roof against the northernmost section.  In front of the

lean-to an area has been cleared to allow a small campfire to be built.

This lean-to has been made from branches lashed together with vines and

then covered by a layer of thatch to help keep the rain out.  The edge of

the lean-to closest to the ground has been decorated with brightly

colored feathers and strings of animal fangs and claws.

Small ferns and plants border a tiny creek that flows in from the west to

disappear into a thick mass of vegetation to the east.  More hospitable,

if somewhat steamy, jungle lies to the south, west and north.  Some sort

of structure, which could be man-made, can be seen through some of the

trees to the north.

A few flower-covered vines hang like garlands from the trees, their color

livening up the dull greys and browns of their bark.  A few flowers have

fallen into a small creek that runs through the area.  The flower's

colors refract on the surface making it seem as if a dappled rainbow

lives beneath the water.  The creek flows in from the west and continues

its journey toward the east.  In all directions the jungle continues.

Steaming Jungle~
Trickling through a corridor of small plants and ferns is a small creek

that flows in from the west and then heads east.  Overhead the jungle's

canopy not only keeps in the thick, muggy air, but provides the small

creek with protection from the elements above.  To the south a thick mass

of trees and vines make it impossible to penetrate deeper into the jungle

that way, but in every other direction the jungle awaits to be explored.

Adding to the difficulty is a haze of humidity that hangs in the air,

Steaming Jungle~
Much movement and chattering comes from the canopy overhead, as well as

the odd shower of leaves.  Many vines dangle down from above, brushing

against the trees, some of the smaller plant life, and even the ground

itself.  More vine-riddled jungle continues to the east, west, and south,

while up a steep incline can be seen a clearing of some sort.

Hot, humid air seems to cling to everything, adding a sticky

unpleasantness to the jungle.  Large trees compete with each other for

the limited floor space, as well as for space amongst the canopy.  Many

vines take advantage of the trees' preoccupation with the battle for

space and quietly spread their flower-covered tendrils about their trunks

and lower branches.  An especially thick section of jungle lies to the

west, preventing any movement in that direction, but more of this steamy

Large vine-covered trees grow in profusion with their foliage providing

the jungle and curves around to the hug the southern section before it

disappears from sight.  The water is travelling at such a fast rate that

swimming in the river is out of the question.  Hanging limply from their

hinges are a pair of wood and thatch gates to a village that lies to the

east.  Two saplings now grow where the gates would have met to block

entry into the village, almost as if they are trying to take over the job

that the gates used to perform.

Steaming Jungle~
A thick tangle of jungle to the west seems to pulsate with hidden life. 

Leaves move of their own violation, scurried movements can be heard, and

what seems to be a hushed whispering moves through the tangled mess.  In

all other directions the jungle is much more open, with just vine-covered

trees, small plants of numerous varieties, and mulch covered ground to be

spied.  To the south however, is a steep, rocky decline.

Steaming Jungle~
Rustling of leaves and the movements of unseen creatures can be heard

from the overhead canopy.  The canopy above filters the light, allowing

only muted rays to bath the floor of the jungle.  Many small plants vie

with each other in an attempt to bask in the soft light.  The jungle

continues in all directions, including down a steep decline to the south.

Steaming Jungle~
A thick mass of trees and vines to the north almost seem intent on

pushing whatever passes through here down a steep, stone-littered decline

to the south.  The few trees in this section of the jungle that allow

easy access through here are covered in vines.  Hanging in the air here

is a permanent cloud of hot, sticky mist which seems to delight in

sapping the strength out of anything it touches.  More, sticky, humid

jungle lies to the east and west.

it.

Steaming Jungle~
This section of the moisture-laden jungle seems slightly claustrophobic

with the densely growing trees, a steep rise to the north, and a tall

wooden wall to the south.  Adding to the clutter are several vines that

dangle from the tree branches above.  Very little light manages to filter

down to the undergrowth as the jungles canopy does its best to block out

the sky above.  The jungle extends to the north, east, and west, but is

held at bay by the wooden wall to the south.

A vine-covered sheer rise to the east looks like it wouldn't be worth the

pain and effort to climb up its vertical surface.  However, the steep

rise to the north does look to be more hospitable.  The trees here are

fairly sparse, and their canopy provides little protection from the

To the north, south, and west the jungle thickens again.

Steaming Jungle~
Although the thick, steaming jungle extends to the north and east with

nothing to stop it, to the south and west a tall wooden wall blocks its

ability to further exert its influence.  The ground here is damp and the

smell of mosses and lichen fills the air whenever the rotting mulch upon

the ground gets disturbed.

Steaming Jungle~
Even with a rock-strewn, steep rise to the north, the individual trees

that make up this jungle are still able to procure enough ground to grow

and maintain a thick overhead canopy.  Several vines hang from the trees

as if they are trying to add a bit of color, with their brightly-colored

flowers, to the trees' otherwise drab, brownish bark.  More jungle and

vines continue in all directions.

The air here is filled with many sounds ranging from the noises of

insects, the singing of birds, and the gurgling of a nearby stream.  From

time to time, these more quiet noises are overshadowed by the crashing

and roaring of falling water.  Although the stream to the east helps

relieve some of the oppressive humidity of the jungle, the overhead

canopy ensures that enough of the hot, moist air is trapped here to cause

discomfort.  More of this steaming jungle continues to the north, south

This clearwater stream is knee-deep, its waters rush around and over the

top of many boulders and large rocks that protrude from the streambed. 

This rushing water is quite strong, and carries anything that doesn't

resist its flow further south to be smashed against the large stones that

form a barrier to the south.  Up a small incline to the west are the many

trees and vines that make up a tropical jungle, with some of the vines

dangling into the water.  To the east lies much thicker jungle, and it is

doubtful that it could be easily navigated.  The combined canopy of the

trees to the left and right keeps the stream well shaded from the

elements overhead.

Steaming Jungle~
Cool air stirred up from the fast flowing rapids to the south and east

provide the occasional moment of relief from the constant humidity of the

jungle.  Trees loom overhead to filter the light from the celestial

bodies above, while smaller plants vie for the remaining space upon the

jungle floor.  To the west lies the broken gates of a village.

At the Gates of the Desolate Village~
The wood and thatch gates have been torn from their hinges and now lie

upon the ground and are slowly being covered in refuse blown in from the

jungle.  The ground, which hasn't been covered by the gates, is bare

except for a few saplings and a couple of small ferns.  On the other side

of the gates is the thick jungle that can also be seen looming over the

wooden wall to the south.  A circular, thatched hut lies to the north,

while an open area can be seen to the west.

A brief gust of wind blows through the area stirring up the dust and the

many dried leaves that litter village's square.  The smell of dead and

decaying things is also carried upon the wind.  A circular, thatched hut,

whose walls and roof have gaping holes throughout them, blocks the way

south.  The dusty square continues to both the north and west, with the

remains of a large bonfire also lying westward.  A set of broken gates

steaming jungle to the south.  In the distant west can be heard the odd

Desolate Village - Remains of a Huge Bonfire~
The remains of a huge bonfire take up most of the village square's center. 

The bonfire pit is contained within a circle of smooth stones, the

diameter of which is approximately eight feet.  A pile of ashes,

long-dead coals, and partially-burnt branches and logs, are the only

things left from a previous fire.  Oddly enough, the center of the

firepit itself is clear of any sign of fire, ash, or debris.  A compacted

ring of earth encircles the bonfire.

Desolate Village~
The smell of decay is very strong here and seems to be the result of the

merging odors coming from the three circular, thatched huts that open

onto this part of the village square.  Above each of the huts'

hide-covered openings is a small stone idol, each direction a different

idol.  The remains of a large bonfire are to the north.

On the floor of this thatched hut is a large bed mat that could easily

bark paintings, but only tattered remains still cling to the hole-ridden

many brightly colored feathers and animal claws and fangs.

In a Desolate Hut~
Nested in the eastern arc of the hut is a large stone statue of an

anthropomorphic jaguar with a burning brazier sitting before it. 

Positioned on the wall around the statue, and arranged so as to resemble

halo around its head, are various trinkets.  In contrast to the area

where the statue stands, the rest of the hut is covered in jungle refuse

that has blown in through the holes in the walls and ceiling, and the

remains of a shredded bed mat.  The only exit from this hut is via a

hide-covered door to the west.
