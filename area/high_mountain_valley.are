Great North Road - In a Narrow Canyon~
The road travels north through a jagged cut in the mountain, and to the

south it heads back out into the open.  The walls and the road are made

of the same hard rock, a dark pink granite dotted with clear quartz and

black speckles.  The scrapes and marks on the vertical walls of this

canyon make it obvious it was not created by natural forces.  The hard

stone walls rise far above the road, leaving it in perpetual shadow.

ruts have been worn into its surface where metal-clad wagon wheels have

ground along in their journeys.

Great North Road - In a Narrow Canyon~
Hard, cold granite rises at least twenty feet straight up above your

head, and the straight-cut walls running north and south are obviously

not a natural formation.  The road's surface is made of the same granite

and is mildly rutted from the passage of wagon wheels and horses. 

Shallow pools of water have collected in the ruts and the water runs

lazily along the subtle southern slope of the road.

Great North Road - In a Narrow Canyon~
The road travels through a canyon with walls that are almost perfectly

vertical, cut into the solid granite of the mountain.  The road is also

made of granite and shows shallow ruts where metal-rimmed wagon wheels

have traveled along on their northern and southern journeys.  The high

walls cast the road into permanent shadow and the chilly breeze does

nothing to warm the air.

Great North Road~
The road heads south into a straight-walled canyon and north across a

wide valley.  Tall, green pine trees grow on the east and west, and dry

pine needles clutter the edges of the road.  The steep slopes of the

Dragonspires rise up on all sides, dwarfing this wide valley with their

immense size.

Great North Road~
The road turns west to avoid a fast moving river on the north and heads

south into a narrow canyon.  The Dragonspire Mountains rise sharply on

all sides, cradling this lush, forested valley within the rugged

countryside.  Tall, dark pine trees grow across the river and throughout

the valley, and their musky scent fills the air.  From this vantage point

the surrounding mountains are unobstructed by trees; their steep slopes

cradle the valley within the rugged countryside.

Great North Road~
The road curves, heading north and east around a bend in the river on the

eastern edge of the road.  The valley that surrounds you is lushly

forested with deep, dark pine trees and the roadside is blanketed with

their fallen needles.  Looking to the north you can see a bridge spanning

the river, leading to a short ledge where the road continues.

The Dakari River flows by on the east and rugged grass grows along the

sides of the wide, well-worn road that runs north and south.  The road is

bordered by a forest of pines on the west that forms a dark green wall

of foliage on that side fo the road.  The forest sounds and rushing water

compete to create a cacophony of sound in the valley.

The road crosses a wide bridge to the north and heads south across the

valley.  The heady, musky scent of pine fills the air, mingling with the

smells of the wildflowers, animals and the river on the east.  Hoof

tracks cross the road and disappear into the forest on the west and

large, pellet-like droppings are scattered on the road.

Great North Road - Bridge Over the Dakari River~
The road travels across a sturdy wooden bridge which spans the

rock-filled Dakari river below.  The bridge is constructed of large

planks placed side by side across its width and it angles upward from the

south to a rock ledge on the north.  The sound of your travel across the

planks rings out through the valley.

erosion by the elements.  Every movement you make echos between the stone

walls, even the softest sound is amplified much louder by the close space.

A narrow ravine ends here with high vertical walls on all sides except

offering passage up and the road follows the ravine south.  A large hoist

is mounted on huge timbers that span the top of the chasm.  The

burden up and down from the ravine.  A large @ecrank@n is mounted on the west

Dakari River - Under a Bridge~
A wide bridge spans across the river and over your head, connecting the

southern bank to a ledge on the north.  The bridge supports are made of

indigenous rock and match the many rounded, small boulders which line the

streambed.  A perpetual breeze flows through this space, following the

river's east-west course, and adds a chill to the air.

Dakari River~
Rounded rocks line the bottom of the shallow river which makes a turn

from east to north.  The tall pine trees of the forest grow right up to

the river's edge on the west and cast their shadows upon the water. 

Upstream, to the east, a wide bridge crosses over the river and connects

the southern banks to a high rock ledge that contains the northwestern

edge of the river.

Dakari River~
The river flows alongside a high ledge which cuts into the valley on the

east.  Small, rounded boulders fill the river and make it tumble along as

it heads downstream to the north.  Through the sounds of the water

flowing you can hear the myriad sounds of the forest emanating from the

trees which line the western bank.

Dakari River~
The river is wider here than it is upstream to the south and the water is

lukewarm.  Rivulets of water flow in from the east, adding to the

stream's volume.  The course of the river makes several sweeping curves

as it heads downstream to the west.  Forest pines encroach on the river's

edge on the north and several withered roots are exposed where the banks

have broken loose.

Dakari River~
The river moves lazily in from the east and gains momentum as it heads

around this curve and travels north.  The water tumbles over and around

large rocks, some of them rounded by their apparent years in the stream

and some of them jagged and fresh-looking.  Trees grow up against the

southern and western banks, and a tall growth of mountain columbines

grows right on the southern bank.

The river splashes and churns through the many boulders that fill the

riverbed, and footing is difficult in the swiftly moving water. 

Downstream to the north looks at least as difficult, but the river

appears calmer to the south.  The banks on the east and west are lined

with tall, evergreen pines and their limbs stretch out toward each other

over the river.

Dakari River - Rapids~
The river makes a sweeping curve, flowing in from the south and heading

downstream to the west.  Its course is made rough by the rocks that fill

footing lies on the north and east, where the pine forest grows against

Dakari River - Waterfall~
Whitewater churns around you, splashing on the slippery rocks and

throwing up a mist that fills the air.  A grey cliff of cracked rock on

the north provides an effective barrier to the water and sends it west to

fall a short distance into a narrow gulley.  Despite the strong current

and slippery rocks, you can move upstream to the south or downstream to

the west and brave the waterfall, but moving east would probably be too

difficult.

To the west, the river drops down a short distance into the gulley you

the water to splash and froth as it makes it's noisy entrance into the

westward journey.  Looking up you can see treetops peeking over the

High Mountain Valley~
Tall pine trees rise up around you and a small river follows a meandering

course on the south and west.  A large fallen pine tree lies on the

forest floor, with moss growing on the shaded side of its trunk.  The

tree shows no signs of decay, but the moss and other plants growing on

and around it indicate that it has probably been here for some time.

The trees grow tall and straight in this forest, sheltered by the tall

peaks which surround the valley.  Birds dart between the treetops and

squirrels hop from limb to limb.  The covering of pine needles on the

forest floor gives shelter to a multitude of insects and you catch

glimpses of them as they scurry in and out of their burrows.

The steep slope of the Dragonspire Mountains creates an impossible

Pine trees grow sparsely in the rocky ground, but become more dense to

the west.  A particularly large boulder rests on the ground, obviously

fallen from the heights.  Lichen covers most of its surface and colors it

yellow, green, brown and black.

High Mountain Valley~
A cliff wall rises up to the north and the slope to the east is almost as

steep.  Little foliage grows in this spot, where the ground is covered

with broken bits of rock.  An occasional spray of rock fragments slides

down the cliff and rains bits of sharp stone on you.  The trees thicken

towards the southwest, where the valley is more open.

the pine cones and needles from the tall trees.  The high, jagged peaks

their sheer height.  An occasional icy breeze washes through the area as

if it came directly from the snowcapped peaks.

A low ledge of exposed granite defines the northern edge of the valley. 

It is too high and smooth to scale, but short in comparison with the high

peaks of the Dragonspires which surround the valley.  The arched mouth of

a cave enters the rocky wall, and the covering of pine needles and other

forest debris is disturbed to show someone or something has been moving

in and out of the cave recently.  Dark pine trees and low, rugged grasses

grow in abundance, interrupted only by the sheer wall and a riverbank

on the west.

The jagged rock walls that define this space arch overhead and barely

Brown pine needles, dried grass and other forest debris lies scattered

about on the ground and has been piled up in a back corner of the cave. 

Despite the fresh air, the strong smell of an animal hovers in the air.

High Mountain Valley~
A steep, rock-strewn mountainside angles abruptly down until it reaches

the floor of the valley, conceding to the smooth, flat land filled with

pine trees.  The soil is rocky but the trees manage to find purchase in

the rich mountain soil between the rocks.  A variety of short grasses and

mountain wildflowers have also found a home here and the rich smell of a

particularly hearty white-flowered bush fills the air.

High Mountain Valley~
A small aspen tree grows here, a straggler from the grove you can see to

the west.  It is dwarfed by the tall evergreen pines growing in most of

the valley.  The squirrels and birds high in the pine trees dart back and

forth, busy collecting bits of food and nesting materials.  A large slab

of rock covers much of the ground in this area.

High Mountain Valley~
The trees grow thin as the valley floor gives way to the mountainside on

the west.  The slope is rocky and steep but the valley floor is open all

around you, and teeming with life.  The mouth of a dark cave lies to the

north and the ground shows recent movement into or out of the cave by

something large.  Aspen trees grow in a grove on the east and the pine

forest continues south.

A Cramped, Dark Cave~
The narrow mouth of the cave allows little light to enter this dim

chamber and the air is somewhat stale.  A strong animal smell makes the

stuffy air seem even worse.  Pine needles, branches and wilted plant

matter have been pushed into a pile on one side of the cave and appear to

serve as a bed for something large.

[Barada] this cave is cramped, but the room size is dino.  this is so trivial I'd be embarrassed to put it on the bugs board

The valley floor gives way to the steep upward slope of the southern

mountain.  The slope is forested and looks like an easy climb for the

experienced.  The trees are thin enough that you can see up to the peaks

which contain this side of the valley.  Their snow-capped tops rise high

into the sky, making the valley seem small in comparison.

green sentinels stand their seemingly eternal watch on all other sides. 

A small cluster of bright wildflowers grows under the shade of a tall,

to the north, where the river splashes down a small waterfall.  You can

hear the noise of tumbling water echoing through the gulley on the

northwest, which is filled from edge to edge with the rushing water. 

Silent, tall trees stand to the south and the forest is thin where the

Mountain wildflowers have taken root and flourish in the open area,

around you except where this rocky clearing opens to the east.

You are positioned amid tall pine trees, and a rushing river curves

around you on the south and west.  The noises of small animals and

insects combine with the gentle whistling of the wind through the trees

to create a low thrumming noise, typical of a mountain forest.  You

occasionally catch a glimpse of a small bird moving among the tree limbs.

covered in brown speckles.  The trees immediately surrounding the hapless

the little yellowed tree.

against the corner of a sheer mountain face on the northeast.  A river

passes by on the west and its rocky streambed looks like it would provide

poor footing.  The forest continues on the north, south and east, and you

can see more trees across the river.

High Mountain Valley~
The tall pine trees grow dense, bordered on the south and west by a

rapidly flowing river.  A large tree has fallen in the southwest corner

of the area and would provide a nice place to rest and watch the water

flow by.  Musky pine scent fills the air and the sounds of birds, insects

and water blend to form a steady hum.

High Mountain Valley~
You are in what seems like a corner, with cliff walls rising far above

your head on the north and east.  The trees are somewhat thin here

because of the perpetual shade of the northern mountain and the

unhospitable, rock-strewn ground.  A series of dark grey rocks, darker

than the rest of the rock fragments which litter the ground, forms an

almost perfect half-circle against the western cliff.

High Mountain Valley~
A high cliff walls-in the eastern side of the valley and provides an

effective barrier to movement in that direction.  The trees grow right up

to the cliffside, brushing against its rock surface with their lush,

green needles.  Several flat rocks lie on the forest floor, nearly

covered with yellow, green and brown lichen.  You can see a river through

the trees in the southwest and the sound of running water fills the air.

High Mountain Valley~
This narrow strip of forested land is hedged in by a sheer cliff wall on

the east and a river on the west.  Toward the south you can look up and

see a road crossing a rocky ledge which extends into the valley.  An

artesian spring bubbles among a cluster of rocks and the water flows down

the slight slope and westward into the river.

High Mountain Valley~
You are at the southern edge of a large valley filled with tall pine

trees.  An outcropping of rock protrudes from the steep slope of the 

mountain to the south.  The ground is littered with small rocks, pine

cones, and pine needles, and a scattered pile of animal droppings lies on

the ground.  A wide road passes by on the east, heading north across the

valley and south into a narrow canyon.

High Mountain Valley~
This part of the valley is cornered between two nearly vertical slopes on

the west and south.  The trees of the forest are thin, where rocky, hard

soil prevents all but the strongest from taking root.  Pebbles and bits

of rock that litter the ground have obviously come down from the slopes.

High Mountain Valley~
Small boulders litter the ground along the river which flows quickly by

on the south.  Bright blue flowers and hardy grasses grow among the

boulders, and the pine trees scattered throughout the area begin to grow

more dense in the northwest.  The scent of pine, grasses and flowers

creates a heady combination and you can hear the musical sound of the

river from the south.  The boulder-strewn slope of the mountain to the

east is steep and appears unstable.

Great pine trees rise up all around, giving you only small glimpses of

the sky.  The ground is covered with pine needles and pinecones, and an

occasional herb or wildflower.  A tall columbine flower grows here,

brightening the forest with its white and purple display.  The mountain

slopes on the west and south are steep, but appear easy enough to climb

for someone with the skill.

The pine trees grow strong and proud all around you, blocking most of

your view of the sky.  Dry pine needles that have fallen from the trees

cover the ground in a lush, brown carpet which dampens the noise of your

passing.  Mountain slopes meet here, sloping down to the valley floor

from the south and west.  If you have the skill you can probably scale

the mountainsides with ease.

to climb.  You can hear the sound of a river mingling with the sounds of

the forest life all around you.

The ground drops off to the north where a gulley cuts across from east to

west and contains the swiftly moving river.  You can see it turn to the

north and wind its way between the mountains.  Trees are sparse, but grow

thicker towards the south and up the slope of the mountain on the west.

The trees are thinner here and the plants on the ground are more

plentiful.  Rugged grasses, columbines, bluebells and blackberries

flourish.  You can see a clearing through the trees to the south and the

slope of the mountains to the west.  The forest floor drops off to the

north, where a river flows through a narrow gulley.  A high, sheer cliff

lies on the other side of the river, rising to an impressive height.
