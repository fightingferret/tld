Top of the Western Staircase~
A large spiraling staircase sweeps out from your feet, heading down to a

lower level.  The wide steps hug the white marble walls all the way down,

leaving a center pillar of wide open space.  An ornately worked dark grey

granite railing runs along the inside of the marbled stairs.  An

extremely large burning brazier hangs from the center of the domed

ceiling high above.  About level with the floor here, it provides more

than enough light even for this cavernous stairwell.  The curved walls

sweep to an archway to the east, leading into a wide hall.

Gallery of Champions~
This broad hall is part of the Gallery of Champions.  These halls were

built to honor the greatest warrior of each age.  Niches are carved into

the white marble walls between the massive granite columns.  A soft white

light fills the hall, seeming to radiate from the smooth, white marble

dome of the ceiling.  The floor beneath you is highly polished marble,

heavily veined with dark stone accents.

Hall of Tournaments~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  Small, irregularly shaped

bits of stone are inlaid in the floor, forming a subtle spiral of colors

that converges in the center of the room.  Nine wide doorways exit from

the room, spaced evenly around the room on the west, north and east.

Gallery of Champions~
This is the central chamber of the Gallery of Champions.  A large,

central pedestal stands in the center of the circular room, holding a

larger-then-life statue of the latest victor.  The white marble walls and

floor contrast sharply with the dark grey granite of the columns.  The

vaulted ceiling soars high overhead, echoing the smallest noise back to

bounce off the floor.  A large tapestry hangs on the southern section of

the curved walls.  The gently curving walls are pierced by stonework

archways to the east and west.  A third arch leads north, into a large

hall lit with flickering torches.

E
tapestry~
The tapestry is made from a fine fabric, silk most likely.  It hangs from

the top of the columns supporting the domed ceiling, and the tips of the

red fringing come just short of the floor.  The background is black,

deeper then the darkest night.  Woven into the fabric, instead of a

picture, is a simple phrase.  It reads, "Today i gave all that i had. 

Anything i kept, i lost forever." There is no attributed author.

Gallery of Champions~
You are in what is known as the Gallery of Champions.  It is so called

because this is the hall where the greatest warrior from each of the ages

is honored.  Niches are carved into the white marble walls between the

massive granite columns.  A soft white light permeates the hall, seeming

to radiate from the plain white marble dome of the ceiling, being held

aloft by the columns.

E
niches~
Starting about waist high to a human, and about ten feet high, these

niches are carved back into the walls enough to hold a statue without

obscuring it.  Each niche holds the statue of a warrior from ages long

past.  Amazing life-like and highly detailed, the statues seem to capture

the essence of each victor.

~
E
statue~
Each statue is carved from a dark material, obsidian most likely.  They

sit on niches carved into the white marble walls.  On the wall below each

statue is a small shelf, some containing a favored object of the victor,

others bearing a plaque.

~
E
column~
These are massive columns, soaring to the ceiling far above you.  Each

has been carved from a solid block of a dark grey granite.  The shafts of

the columns are relief carved with scenes of great victory.

Hall of Tournaments~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  Small, irregularly shaped

bits of stone are inlaid in the floor, forming a subtle spiral of colors

that converges in the center of the room.  Nine wide doorways exit from

the room, spaced evenly around the room on the west, north and east.

Bottom of the Western Staircase~
A large spiraling staircase rises from the floor and heads up to the next

level.  Steps, wide enough for eight armored men walking abreast, hug the

white marble walls leaving a wide open space in the middle.  The inner

edge of the steps is bordered by an intricately carved dark grey granite

railing.  A cheerfully crackling bonfire sits in a brazier high up, near

the top end of the stairwell, providing enough light and warmth to rival

a warm summer day.  A set of wooden double doors are set into the wall to

the west.  The stairwell gives way into a large open room to the east.

This is a vast open-air room.  The north wall is actually a short wall

about as tall as a halfling.  Just high enough to keep inattentive

spectators from inadvertantly becoming part of the games in the arena

itself.  A row of tall, graceful marble columns march arcoss the south

wall, supporting a vaulted ceiling.  To the east smooth, white marble

walls close in, forming a graceful archway.

Colosseum Gallery~
A vast vaulted ceiling soars high over your head.  Highly polished,

lightly veined marble lies beneath your feet.  A pair of gigantic marble

doors hang on the north wall.  Opened flat against the inside here, they

look like massive stone tablets.  A massive column flanks each door,

holding up the north side of the high ceiling, and leaving the rest of

the area open to the arena below.  A low wall, about waist high to a

human, runs out from each column, providing a surface to lean on while

watching the procedings below.  Across the south a row of tall, more

graceful columns stand to support the other end of the soaring ceiling

and a small doorway leads into the infirmary.

Colosseum - South Side, Entrance~
You are on the southern side of a large, open arena.  Massive marble

columns surround the rectangular space except on the south where a

veiwing stand overlooks the battleground.  The columns support the floor

of a second story over your head, and you can see between them into the

forest that surrounds the complex.  The floor of this arena is dry,

hard-packed dirt and provides good footing for the combatants who come

here to test their skill.  Fresh air washes through the open area,

filling you with strength and vigor as you prepare to test your mettle. 

An exit into the viewing stands lies to the south.

marble columns surround the rectangular space except on the south where a

veiwing stand overlooks the battleground.  The columns support the floor

of a second story over your head, and you can see between them into the

forest that surrounds the complex.  The floor of this arena is dry,

hard-packed dirt and provides good footing for the combatants who come

here to test their skill.  Fresh air washes through the open area,

filling you with strength and vigor as you prepare to test your mettle.

[Janua] It would be a good idea to put all acodes used in the arena here,

then use the acode() function to point to them.  It will make debugging,

cutomizing for a tourney, etc., much easier

The fine surface has been wrought with scenes of battle and glory, and

intricately detailed ivy worked in slightly darker gold spirals up each

column set in the room's corners.  The ceiling rises high above your head

and an elegantly appointed viewing stand for spectators sits above the

arena to the east.  A pair of heavy iron gates stand at the entrance to

the east, blocking your exit in that direction.

Hall of Tournaments - Entrance to Yellow Arena~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  A marble staircase leads up

to a viewing area and a wide doorway leads east into the @Yyellow@n arena.

Hall of Tournaments - Entrance to Cyan Arena~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  A marble staircase leads up

to a viewing area and a wide doorway leads east into the @Ccyan@n arena.

Hall of Tournaments - Entrance to Red Arena~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  A marble staircase leads up

to a viewing area and a wide doorway leads north into the @Rred@n arena.

Hall of Tournaments - Entrance to Gold Arena~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  A marble staircase leads up

to a viewing area and a wide doorway leads west into the @ygold@n arena.

Hall of Tournaments - Entrance to Platinum Arena~
The ceiling of this large hall is a high dome of milky white marble.  The

battle scenes carved in relief on the surface of the walls take on a life

of their own in the flickering torchlight.  A marble staircase leads up

to a viewing area and a wide doorway leads west into the @Wplatinum@n arena.

Secres Access Passageway - Entrance to Gold Arena~
This hallway is very narrow and dark, with no windows or torches to

provide a source of light.  The walls are rough-hewn, dark stone with a

roughly arched ceiling.  The floor is a hazy, nearly transparent @ygold@n

color, and you can see the shadowy forms of people moving below.  As you

move along the hallway you have a strange sensation in your belly as if

each step took you a fair distance greater than a single step.

Colosseum - North Side~
You are on the northern side of a large, open arena.  Massive marble

columns surround the rectangular space except on the south where a

veiwing stand overlooks the battleground.  The columns support the floor

of a second story over your head, and you can see between them into the

forest that surrounds the complex.  The floor of this arena is dry,

hard-packed dirt and provides good footing for the combatants who come

here to test their skill.  Fresh air washes through the open area,

filling you with strength and vigor as you prepare to test your mettle.

Western Entrance to the Arena~
You are in a wide, open foyer that serves as the western entrance to the

blah Arena.  Pale, ivory marble walls rise well above your head in a

sweeping arch that leads into a hallway to the north.  A road passes by

just outside the entry and the floor is marked by a few dusty footprints

from those who have come here before you.  The walls are smooth and bare,

which serves to highlight the delicate veining of the pale marble.

Secret Access Passageway - Entrance to the Colosseum~
This hallway is very narrow and dark, with no windows or torches to

provide a source of light.  The walls are rough-hewn, dark stone with a

roughly arched ceiling.  The floor is a hazy, nearly transparent

@Wivory@n color, and you can see the shadowy forms of people moving

below.  As you move along the hallway you have a strange sensation in

your belly as if each step took you a fair distance greater than a single

step.

Private Chamber~
Walls of the purest marble enclose you and lend a sense of peace to this

room.  A roaring flame in the fireplace on the eastern wall warms your

face and sends light bouncing off the gleaming crystalline door to the

west.  Along the northern and southern walls are raised reliefs depicting

an elvish monk defeating his enemies in combat, his latticework tattoo

etched in gold and his hair blowing in the wind.

crystalline door 1 west~
This door is made of gleaming crystal and holds within it all the colors

of the rainbow.  Upon closer examination there is a small hole where a

key could be inserted.

Eastern Entrance to the Arena~
You are in a wide, open foyer that serves as the eastern entrance to the

Arena of Blood.  Pale, ivory marble walls rise well above your head in a

sweeping arch that leads into a hallway to the north.  A road passes by

just outside the entry and the floor is marked by a few dusty footprints

from those who have come here before you.  The walls are smooth and bare,

which serves to highlight the delicate veining of the pale marble.
